Description
-----------

The HTMLinterface class allows a CGI interface to a database.
It enables a CGI interface to a database to be created, supporting record addition,
modification, deletion and searching. It provides a user friendly interface with
descriptions of fields provided. The field descriptions along with information on
whether the field is visible, hidden or excluded are extracted from a table, allowing
easy modification and addition of fields and tables without having to edit code.

Build and Install
-----------------

To install, simply change into the folder containing the uncompressed distribution 
and at the command prompt type:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

No testing routines are currently available in this beta.

Further Information
-------------------

Full documentation is provided in POD format in HTMLinterface.pm. You should be 
able to view this after installation using the perldoc command.

[TODO: Test this - does the makefile install this correctly?]
